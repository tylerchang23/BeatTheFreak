## Introduction

As the NBA regular season comes to a close, fans across the globe wait eagerly for some exciting playoff action (shoutout Dame Dolla). Coming off an insane MVP season last year, Giannis Antetokounpo and the Milwaukee Bucks yet again sit at the top of the Eastern Conference. With Giannis in the running for another MVP title, it's no secret that they will be a force to be reckoned with in the post-season. Before the sudden shutdown, the Bucks had a whopping 53-12 record, in which Giannis only played in 9 of those losses.

It's obvious that Giannis is one of the most important factors to the Bucks' success, so what can you do to stop him? This project will focus on finding the strengths/weaknesses of the Bucks/Giannis, and what strategies could potentially be used to stop them.

## Goals

There are a few different questions I want to answer in this analysis:

* **What makes Giannis good?**

* **What traits are prevalent in teams that have proven to be successful against the Bucks?**

* **What tendencies does Giannis have when shooting?**

* **Is there a model that can predict how many points Giannis will score in a given game?**

## Tools (Python)

* **Data Collection:** *nba_api, Pandas*

* **Data Visualization:** *matplotlib*

* **Machine Learning:** *sklearn, statsmodels*

## Results

***What makes Giannis so good?***

To simply answer this question, we first looked at Giannis as an individual player. Giannis, a near 7 footer, uses his massive size to dominate the paint at the forward position. Not only does he possess the height, but he has also acquired more and more muscle year by year.

I think anyone that's watched Giannis play can confirm that his physique definitely gives him an advantage over other players. But how does he compare to other forwards in the league? 

-insert pts vs. total rebounds scatterplot here- 

Here is a scatterplot of the top 20 scoring forwards in the league this season. Here we can see the clear gap between him and the best forwards in the NBA, including the likes of LeBron James (4x MVP, 3x NBA Champion, 16x All-Star) and Kawhi Leonard (reigning NBA Finals MVP, 2x NBA Champion, x6 All-Star). 

Another aspect we looked at was the rest of the Bucks roster. I think a lot of Giannis' success in the league can and should be acredited to his teammates. Although he doesn't have a Steph Curry in his back pocket, Giannis definitely has some three-point assasains that allow him to use his length and athleticism with ease down low. The league average three-point percentage sits at 33.8% this regular season. How do the rest of the Bucks
